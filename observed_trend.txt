1.There are more cities distributed in the north of the equator than in the south of equator since more cities were found in the north using a random algorithm to choose geo-coordinates.

2. Closer cities get to the equator, higher these cities' max temperatures get.

3. It seems levels of humidity, cloudless, and wind speed in cities do not have an coordination with the latitudes of these cities as cities with a similar latitude show a wide range of levels of humidity, cloudless and wind speed.
